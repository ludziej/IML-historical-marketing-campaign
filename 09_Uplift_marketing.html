<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Running a business is a challenge. It involves making a lot of decisions to maximize profits and cut down costs - finding the tradeoff is not a straightforward task.
Here come Machine Learning and uplift models that can help in optimizing marketing costs.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that it is good idea to send marketing offer to all company’s customers. From one point of view by sending an offer we think the probability that the customer will buy our product is higher - in fact it is not always the cases (the matter will be described in details later). On the other hand, making a large-scale campaign is costly. Therefore it is important to consider what iReturn on Investment (ROI) in decision-making.</p>
<p>Is it true that by sending the marketing offer we only extend the chance for the customer to buy our product and therefore extend our profit? The issue was already investigated <span class="citation">(Verbeke and Bravo <a href="#ref-book_uplift" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and it was pointed out that customers of any company can be divided into 4 groups (Figure: <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:4groups">6.1</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:4groups"></span>
<img src="images/09_e45e2d97-confmatrix_alt.png" alt="Customer types taking into consideration their response to treatment [@4groups_chart]" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.1: Customer types taking into consideration their response to treatment <span class="citation">(Yi and Frost <a href="#ref-4groups_chart" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a><a href="#ref-4groups_chart" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The matrix (Figure: <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:4groups">6.1</a>) was created based on customer decision to buy a product depending on the fact that they were addressed by a marketing campaign or not. The action used for triggering in customers the particular behavior is called treatment. In the 4 groups we distinguish:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:darkgreen"><strong><em>“persuadables”</em></strong></span>: the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaign would not buy a product</li>
<li><span style="color:grey"><strong><em>“sure things”</em></strong></span>: the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or not are going to buy a product</li>
<li><span style="color:grey"><strong><em>“lost causes”</em></strong></span>: the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or not are <strong>NOT</strong> going to buy a product</li>
<li><span style="color:darkred"> <strong><em>“sleeping dogs”</em></strong></span>: the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaign would buy a product but in case they receive a marketing offer they resign</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be then observed that in case of <em>“lost causes”</em> and <em>“sure things”</em> sending a marketing offer makes no impact therefore it doesn’t make sense to spend money on targeting these customers. As the company we should however pay more attention to the groups <em>“persuadables”</em> and <em>“sleeping dogs”</em>. In the case of the first group, bearing the costs of the marketing campaign will bring benefits. In the case of the latter, we not only spend money on targeting them but as a result, we will also discourage them from buying the product therefore we as a company loose twice. The case of <em>“sleeping dogs”</em> can seem irrealistic, therefore we present an example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Let’s imagine there is a customer that subscribed to our paid newsletter. He forgot that he pays each month fixed fee. He would continue paying unless a company sends him a discount offer. At this moment the customer realizes that he doesn’t need the product and unsubscribes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By understanding the structure of the customers, company can target its offer more effectively.</p>
<div id="approaches-towards-uplift-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Approaches towards uplift modeling</h3>
<p>In <span class="citation">(Akshay Kumar <a href="#ref-uplift_stanford" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> it was pointed out that the problem of deciding whether it is profitable to send an offer to a particular customer can be tackled from two different perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>predictive response modeling (it is common classification task where model assigns a probability to each of the classes)<br />
</li>
<li>uplift modeling (where the “incremental” probability of purchase is modeled)</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is tailored to this particular task and is more challenging.
<strong>Uplift modeling is a technique that helps to determine probability gain that the customer by getting the marketing materials will buy a product.</strong>
The field is relatively new. The two most common approaches are <span class="citation">(Lee <a href="#ref-uplift_approaches" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Two Model</strong><br />
In this method two classifiers are build. The one is trained on observations that received treatment (called <em>model_T1</em>) and the second is trained on observations that didn’t receive treatment (called <em>model_T0</em>). Later the uplift for particular observations is calculated. If the observation experienced treatment then it is an input to the <em>model_T1</em> and the probability that the customer will buy a product is predicted. Next it is investigated what would happen if the customer didn’t receive treatment. In that case the treatment indicator in observation’s feature is changed to “zero”. Such a modified record is an input to <em>model_T0</em> that predicts the probability that such a customer will buy a product. The uplift is calculated as the difference between the output of the <em>model_T1</em> and <em>model_T0</em>. The higher the difference, the more profitable is addressing marketing campaign to a particular customer. Analogically, uplift is computed for the people that didn’t experienced treatment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One Model</strong><br />
This approach is similar conceptually to the <em>Two Model</em> approach with such a difference that instead of building two classifiers only one is used. Therefore every observation is an input to the model that generates prediction. Later the indicator in the treatment column is changed into the negation and such a vector is used as input to the model that once again output probability that the customer buys a product. The uplift is the difference between the two predicted probabilities.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>As uplift modeling is an emerging field there isn’t a clear evidence what method is better to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="dataset-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Dataset</h2>
<p>There is a scarcity of well-documented datasets dedicated to uplift modeling. Therefore the authors of <span class="citation">(Rzepakowski and Jaroszewicz <a href="#ref-uplift_dataset_modification" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> proposed to artificially modify available datasets to extract information about treatment. As the purpose of this story is to investigate XAI techniques in the domain of uplift modeling we decided to use real-life dataset.
We chose Kevin Hillstrom’s dataset from E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge <span class="citation">(Hillstrom <a href="#ref-uplift_dataset_marketing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. The dataset consists of 64000 records reflecting customers that last purchased within 12 months. As a treatment an e-mail campaign was addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 of customers were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Men’s merchandise</li>
<li>1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Women’s merchandise</li>
<li>1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign <em>(“control group”)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As an expected behavior the following actions were determined:</p>
<ul>
<li>visit the company’s website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign</li>
<li>purchase a product from the website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>In the challenge the task was to determine whether the men’s or women’s e-mail campaign was successful. In order to simplify the problem we reformulated the task - we have focused on answering the question whether any e-mail campaign persuaded customers to buy a product.</p>
<p>The features about customers in the dataset are specified in Figure <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:dataset">6.3</a>:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:dataset"></span>

<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.3: Customer features in the dataset (own elaboration)
</p>
</div>
<p>In the dataset there is also information about customer activity in the two weeks following delivery of the e-mail campaign (these can be interpreted as labels):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visit</em>: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer visited website in the following two weeks</li>
<li><em>Conversion</em>: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer purchased merchandise in the following two weeks</li>
<li><em>Spent</em>: Actual dollars spent in the following two weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>[wstawić histogram recency i history!!!]</p>
<div id="explanatory-data-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Explanatory Data Analysis</h3>
First we decided to investigate variable that have more than 3 unique values. At the same thime these variables (<em>recency</em> and <em>history</em>) intuitively seem to be the most important while predicting whether someone will buy a product or not.
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histogram"></span>
<img src="images/09_recency.PNG" alt="Histograms of *recency* (left) and *history* (right)" width="40%" /><img src="images/09_history.PNG" alt="Histograms of *recency* (left) and *history* (right)" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.4: Histograms of <em>recency</em> (left) and <em>history</em> (right)
</p>
</div>
<p>It can be seen that <em>history</em> variable has heavy-tailed distribution therefore it may be reasonable to use Box-cox tranformation. However, we decided to keep the variable without any preprocessing for the easier interpretation.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:countplots"></span>
<img src="images/09_count_plots.PNG" alt="Count plots" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.5: Count plots
</p>
</div>
<p>In case of <em>mens</em>, <em>womens</em> and <em>newbie</em> variables the proportion of 0’s to 1’s is almost equal. There is much fewer record of people living in countryside than in Urban or Suburban area. Most of the company customers buy via phone or web. It is rare that someone uses mulitchannel option. In the dataset most of the customers received treatment in the form of marketing E-mail.</p>
</div>
<div id="feature-engineering" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Feature engineering</h3>
<p>Regarding labels the dataset is largely imbalanced - there are only about 15% of positive cases in column <em>Visit</em> and 9% in column <em>Conversion</em>.
In such a situation we decided to use column <em>Visit</em> as a target for the classifier.
As the number of columns is small we decided to use one-hot encoding for transforming categorical variables instead of target encoding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="model-exploration-and-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Model exploration and metrics</h2>
<p>There are not many packages dedicated to uplift modeling in python. We investigated the two: pylift <span class="citation">(Yi and Frost <a href="#ref-pylift" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a><a href="#ref-pylift" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> and pyuplift <span class="citation">(Kuchumov <a href="#ref-pyuplift" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. The latter enables usage of 4 types of models - one of those is the Two Model approach. In the pylift package there is the TransformedOutcome class that generates predictions. However, the model itself is not well described and uses XGBRegressor underneath that is not intuitive. Fortunately the package offer also the class UpliftEval that allows uplift metrics visualization.
In the scene, we decided to create own classifier (as in the One Model approach) and use UpliftEval class from the pylift package for metric evaluation.
As the classifier we used fine-tuned XGBoost with the score function as the area under the cumulative gain chart (described below). In the figure <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:upliftRES">6.6</a> we show the cumulative gain chart for train and test sets.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:upliftRES"></span>
<img src="images/09_uplift_train.png" alt="Cumulative gain chart: (left) train set, (right) test set" width="50%" /><img src="images/09_uplift_test.png" alt="Cumulative gain chart: (left) train set, (right) test set" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.6: Cumulative gain chart: (left) train set, (right) test set
</p>
</div>
<p>The Qini curve is not suggested for perfomence evaluation of uplift models as it is vulnerable to overfitting to the treatment label. Therefore the Cumulative gain chart is used. It is the least biased estimate of the uplift. In the package pylift it is implemented based on the formula:
<span class="math inline">\(Cumulative\ gain(\phi) = (\frac {n_{t,1}(\phi)}{n_{t,1}}-\frac {n_{c,1}(\phi)}{n_{c,1}})(\frac{n_t(\phi)+n_c(\phi)}{N_t+N_c})\)</span><br />
where<br />
<span class="math inline">\(n_{t,1} (\phi)\)</span> is the number of observations in the treatment group at cutoff level <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> with label 1<br />
<span class="math inline">\(n_{c,1} (\phi)\)</span> is the number of observations in the control group at cutoff level <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> with label 1<br />
<span class="math inline">\(n_{t,1}\)</span> is the total number of observations in the treatment group with label 1 (analogically <span class="math inline">\(n_{c,1}\)</span>)<br />
<span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> is the total number of observations in treatment group (analogically <span class="math inline">\(N_c\)</span>)</p>
<p>The theoretical plot is created according to the following scheme:<br />
First the customers are sorted in descending order based on predicted uplift. Later some fraction of data is taken for the analysis (e.g. 10% of the people with the highest score). This cutoff is represented as <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> in the formula. Next the uplift gain is verified for the subset. At the beginning of the curve the gain is the biggest as it refers to the <em>“persuadables”</em> group. Later the curve stabilizes as it depicts the groups: <em>“lost causes”</em> and <em>“sure things”</em>. At the end the curve decreases as there are <em>“sleeping dogs”</em> with negative uplift.</p>
<div id="model-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Model</h3>
<p>It can be seen that our model is better than random choice but much worse than the practical/theoretical maximum possible. It is also worse than the case without <em>“sleeping dogs”</em>.
However we have to remember what this uplift score indicates. Maximum uplift would mean, that we can always persuade anyone to buy, which is obviously an unrealistic scenario, since our <em>treatment</em> is only a single advertisement. Comparing to uplift modeling in different domains, i. e. medical usages, our treatment has generally smaller impact on individual, therefore dataset itself is more noisy and cumulative gains are smaller. It is also worth noting, that due to small number of features, there are multiple cases in the dataset where two observations with same features have different answers. This kind of noise in data also tremendously impacts the score and requires caution when training models. Also, since uplift itself is an interaction, our model do have to take them into consideration.</p>
<p>Taking previous observations into consideration, model was found using so called local search procedure, what means that we choose some meta-parameters of the model and iteratively, for every meta-parameter approximate derivative by sampling the local neighbourhood of current value and follow the ascending gradient. Local search stops naturally, when in previus iteration, we did not change any parameter, hence we hit one of the local minima. To be clear, if meta-paremeter is discrete, by approximating local neighborhood we mean just checking close values. For our score function, we’ve chosen cross validation on cumulative gains. This kind of procedure should seek for highly robust models. Therefore, it is worth noticing that our model didn’t experience any overfitting as its quality on the train and test sets is similar. The resulting major parameters were: maximum depth of 5, high learning rate of 0.7 and only 12 estimators.</p>
</div>
<div id="comparing-metrics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Comparing metrics</h3>
<p>We tried to employ the same local search procedure (as desribed in Model section) using accuracy as score function. However, it failed to converge with any decent quality, because this metric is much less informative in case of largely imbalanced dataset. Since only a small number of customers actually purchased, it’s hard to correctly predict a positive case using non-overfitted model. Therefore within the local search with accuracy function, starting local neighborhood was always flat. This might be because in the dataset there is more noise than positive cases. But fortunately, only important factor, from our prespective is <em>probability</em> of the purchase, since uplift is increase of purchase probability after treatment, and it directly transfers into money gain.
To visualize it in a straightforward manner, we present a table comparing our current robust XGBoost model with overfitted one (deep trees, 100 estimators).</p>

<p>The Cumulative gain chart (Figure <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:upliftRES">6.6</a>) shows that the proposed model brings additional value. Here comes the question of whether the model is reliable? Does it make the decision based on the features that are important from an expert perspective?

<p>As can be seen (Table <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#tab:personalTABLE">6.2</a>) the customers spend almost the same amount of money during the last 12 months on our company’s products.
The person with the highest uplift did last shopping 2 months ago whereas the person with the lowest uplift did it 5 months ago. In the dataset some people purchased the product for the last time even 12 months ago so the person is not the most severe case in that sense. Apart from many other differences among the two customers the key is that the person with the highest uplift received treatment whereas the second customer didn’t.</p>
Below we present SHAP values for the customer desribed in Table <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#tab:personalTABLE">6.2</a>. The values were computed directly on uplift model <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:upliftSHAP">6.7</a>.

<p>In can be seen that in both cases big contribution to the final result has information about customer history (about 235 USD) and the fact that the customer bought products from Womens collection. What is interesting is the fact that the customers have almost the same values of these two attributes but opposite sign of its contribution.</p>
<p><strong>We can benefit from additive feature attribution property of SHAP values to model the uplift:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(uplift=P(purchase|\ T=1) - P(purchase|\ T=0))\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(SHAP(uplift)= SHAP(P(purchase|\ T=1)) - SHAP(P(purchase|\ T=0))\)</span></p>
<p>This property gives us a great opportunity to evaluate these two vectors of SHAP values independently. For example if we use any tree-based model, we can make use of tree-based kernel for SHAP value estimation (faster and better convergent) instead of modeling it directly as a black-box (uplift) model.</p>
<p>In a table <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#tab:upliftTABLE">6.3</a> there is a comparison of SHAP values obtained using two methods for the customer with the lowest uplift.</p>

<p>Experimental results proved, that these two ways of calculatiing SHAP values are providing close estimations with precision to numerical errors. There are few features that depending on method have small positive or negative value. This is caused by the fact that for the estimation of SHAP values directly using uplift model the KernelExplainer was used. It has data parameter however in case of big dataset it is recommended in the documentation to take subset of records. In our case we took random subset therefore this could impact the results. Nevertheless, we proved that in case of our example the two methods lead to similar values.</p>
<p>The specificity of uplift models in terms of the possibility to analyse them through additivity of SHAP values gives room for another valuable inspection.
Below we present how SHAP values differ depending on the fact that the customer was or wasn’t addressed by treatment. On <em>x</em> axis there are SHAP values in case T=0 and on <em>y</em> axis in case T=1. In each chart there is SHAP value referring to one variable. In situation when the SHAP values are the same irrespective of the presence or absence of treatment they would lie on identity line. Moreover, there is color used as third dimension indicating the group that the particular customer belongs to. We decided to merge two groups (<em>“sure things”</em> and <em>“lost causes”</em>) as they have uplift almost equal to zero, therefore now we can distinguish 3 groups: <em>“sleeping dogs”</em>, <em>“persuadables”</em> and <em>“sure things and lost causes”</em>. The division was based on the predicted uplift. <em>“Sleeping dogs”</em> have considerable negative uplift, <em>“sure things and lost causes”</em> have uplift in <span class="math inline">\([-0.01,0.01]\)</span> and <em>“persuadables”</em> have uplift greater than 0.01. The group <em>“sure things and lost causes”</em> should has zero uplift, but due to numerical issues we decided to set <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> equal to 0.01. As almost all customers were categorized to <em>“persuadables”</em>, we decided to show on the plot only 1000 records from this group to maintain chart readability.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s impossible to calculate directly Permutation Feature Importance, because of the previously mentioned problem with lack of full information. We don’t know if the client purchase product after treatment or will he buy without treatment as well. Because of having in disposal only historical data (not an oracle), we have only one of these two pieces of information. However, we can make use of the previously computed SHAP values of uplift to calculate the same value of permutational feature importance as an average of local SHAP importance (defined in a permutational way itself, however, calculated more smartly <span class="citation">(Lundberg and Lee <a href="#ref-feature_importance_shap" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>).</p>

[SPRAWDZIc CZY WNIOSKI NADAL PRAWDZIWE GDY WSTAWIMY NOWE WYKRESY]
Regardless of the customer groups always <em>history</em> and <em>womens</em> are among three most important features. This variables in the case of <em>“sleeping dogs”</em> and <em>“sure things and lost causes”</em> have negative correlation with target variable, whereas in the case of <em>“persuadables”</em> they have positive impact. It is wort noticing that regardless of the customer group importance of <em>segment</em> variable is low. This is suprising because the presence of <em>treatment</em> is substantial element of uplift modeling.What is intersting is the fact that regarding <em>zip code</em> only the information whether someone is from rural area is important. Note that this category of dwelling place was the least popular among customers. Information about purchase channel in general doesn’t have considerable predictive power.</p>
<div id="dependence-profiles" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2.1</span> Dependence profiles</h4>
<p>Another tool to investigate model are the dependence plots. There are two options. The most common method is the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)/ Accumulated Local Effects (ALE). and the another one is the SHAP dependence plot. The Partial Dependence Plot shows the marginal effect that one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model <span class="citation">(Friedman <a href="#ref-pdp" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>. It tells whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. In the SHAP dependence plot we can show how a feature value (<em>x</em> axis) impacted the prediction (<em>y</em> axis) of every sample (each dot) in a dataset <span class="citation">(Lundberg et al. <a href="#ref-shap_dependence_plot" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. This provides richer information than the traditional Partial Dependence Plot, because we have at least two additional information: density, variance of observations.</p>
<p>Partial dependence plots reflect the expected output of the model if only one feature value is changed and rest stays the same. In contrast, the SHAP value for a feature represents how much that feature impacted the prediction for single sample, accounting for interaction effects. So while in general you would expect to see similar shapes in a SHAP dependence plot and a Partial Dependence Plot they will be different if your model has multi-variable interaction effects (like AND or OR). A Partial Dependence Plot has no vertical dispersion and so no indication of how much interaction effects are driving the models predictions <span class="citation">(Lundberg <a href="#ref-shap_dependence_plot_explained" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>We generated the Partial Dependence Plot for all features and the SHAP dependence plot based on 1000 observations only for <em>history</em> and <em>recency</em> features due to large processing time.</p>

<p>For our model the SHAP Dependence Plot reflects the shape of the Partial Dependence Plot. Contribution of <em>history</em> to the final uplift prediction differs among people with the same value of <em>history</em>. It can be seen that there is a considerable peak on the chart for <em>history</em> value about 230 USD. The following conlusions can be drawn:</p>
<ul>
<li>people that spend about 230 USD have various SHAP values</li>
<li>people who spend about 230 USD and have very high SHAP value, have at the same time small recency meaning they bought a product recently.</li>

<p>It is suprising that the disproportion between the results shown in Figure <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:PDPmenswomens">6.16</a> is so significant.

<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>Since Partial Dependence Profiles are generally parallel to Accumulated Local Effects, we can safely assume that our model does not have (major) interactions. However this does not mean, that we can use some classifier without interactions, because here we model directly the uplift, which is difference between preditions and is itself an interaction.</p>
<div id="sweet-spot" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.5.0.1</span> Sweet-spot</h4>
<p>The most important observation here, should be that while at first glance we can only manipulate the <em>treatment</em> variable, dependence profiles also give us opportunity to <strong>choose best time to contact the customer</strong>. Intuitively, <em>recency</em> function should be concave, aiming to find some “sweet-spot” between time when customer “just went out from the shop” and “forgot about this”. The Figure @ref(fig:pdp_recency) is indeed concave but only for <em>recency</em> values between 1 and 4. For larger <em>recency</em> there is sinusoidal noise observed. This fluctuations can be interpreted as small overfitting. The key message is that the sweet-spot appears to be two months after last purchase.</p>
</div>
<div id="biggest-influence" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.5.0.2</span> Biggest influence</h4>
<p>Based on Figure @ref(fig:pdp_mens_womens) the biggest influence can be achieved on customers who bought womens products than the ones who bought products from mens collections. Initially we removed from the dataset information about treatment type (Woman’s/Man’s e-mail). But based on Variable Importance analysis (Figures: <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:sleepingDOGS">6.11</a>, <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:noIMPACT">6.12</a>, <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:persuadables">6.13</a>) we can reason about the type that maximizes uplift for particular person. Considering how important is <em>womens</em> variable, we propose a following policy: regardless of the fact whether someone buys from mens or womens collections we should send e-mails dedicated to womens.</p>
</div>
<div id="influence-from-other-factors" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.5.0.3</span> Influence from other factors</h4>
<p>Other plots can be used for better understanding of the customer persuadability. Since the only variable considerably reducing estimated uplift is newbie we can safely conclude, that marketing campaigns have better impact on regular customers, which is quite an intuitive conclusion. Analysing other factors, one-hot-encoded area of living (<em>zip_code_Rural</em>, <em>zip_code_Suburban</em>, <em>zip_code_Urban</em>) do not have any major influences bigger than statistical error maybe except <em>rural</em>. Customers living on countryside are more likely to be persuaded. Suprisingly it is the only factor that may have some interactions. Referring to purchase channel, it is best to target customers who bought only by web in past months. It may be connected to the fact that our treatment is conducted via e-mail, however the differences are minor. We suspect that in some cases the following situation can happen. Someone buys via phone as he doesn’t use internet offen. In such cases e-mail campaigns will not be effective.</p>

<div id="summary-and-conclusions-4" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Summary and conclusions</h2>
<p>Using XAI for uplift modeling helps to understand its complex models better. The analysis goes beyond just assessing whether the model is reliable.</p>
<div id="individual-perspective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1</span> Individual perspective</h3>
<p>In case of our task individual perpective doesn’t seem to be vital. Unlikely that customer will write an e-mail to the company asking whether he didn’t receive an e-mail with marketing campaign. Even if he does, he wouldn’t change his dwelling area only in order to get the e-mail. The only thing that the customer can rather easy change his value of <em>recency</em> or <em>history</em> variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-scientist-perspective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.2</span> Data scientist perspective</h3>
<p>In the data scientist perspective the most important thing to check is whether the model is overfitted. The tool that can help in verifying model sensitivity is the Partial Dependence Plot. In case of our model it can be seen that the model is slightly overfitted as there is a peak on PDP of <em>history</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="executive-perspective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.3</span> Executive perspective</h3>
<p>XAI techniques can help the executives to understand better the company customers - their behavior without paying for some extra surveys to investigate their attitude towards the company. Key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>the campaign e-mail should be send two months after last purchase in order to be more effective.</li>
<li>the most important variables in the model seem to be resonable, e.g. <em>history</em> and <em>recency</em> (Figures: <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:sleepingDOGS">6.11</a>, <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:noIMPACT">6.12</a>, <a href="story-uplift-marketing1.html#fig:persuadables">6.13</a>). The only suprising thing is high importance of <em>zip_code_Rural</em> feature.</li>
<li>In the case of bigger number of treatment variants it would be possible to create personalized marketing campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>A vital part of our work was adjusting XAI techniques for the particularities of uplift modeling. We found out that thanks to its additivity SHAP values are well suited for uplift modeling - we showed two methods of using it. We identified limitations of well-known Permutation Feature Importance in terms of explaining uplift modeling. It is caused by the fact that unlike in other supervised models here we do not have exactly labels. Therefore we used the generalization of SHAP values that converge to Permutation Feature Importance. Also we analised the SHAP Dependence Plots as an alternative to PDP. We employed the analysis for the three groups of customers based on the corresponding uplift.</p>
<p>…………………………………..</p>
<p>Here add the most important conclusions related to the XAI analysis.
What did you learn?
Where were the biggest difficulties?
What else did you recommend?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="future-works" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Future works</h2>
<p>During initial feature engineering, we simplified our problem by merging <em>womens treatment</em> and <em>mens treatment</em> into one. By analysing PDP we were able to propose a policy for choosing the optimal treatment type. However, it is not the only possible approach. We can try going beyond standard uplift modeling and model directly uplift with 2 possible outcomes i.e. create <em>purchase</em> prediction, and then check if sending <em>womens</em> or <em>mens</em> email is more profitable, resulting in following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(uplift=max{(P(purchase\ |\ w\_T=1) - P(purchase\ |\ w\_T=0,m\_T=0), \\ P(purchase\ |\ m\_T=1) - P(purchase\ |\ w\_T=0,m\_T=0))}\)</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>w_T is womens treatment</li>
<li>m_T is mens treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this leaves us with several open-ended questions i.e.: can we now calculate SHAP values indirectly, using previously presented effecient technique (based on additivity)? Surely the max function breaks the additivity of uplift function, but maybe it is possible using some other method?</p>
