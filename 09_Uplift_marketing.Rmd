## Introduction 

Running a business is a challenge. It involves making a lot of decisions to maximize profits and cut down costs - finding the tradeoff is not a straightforward task.
Here come Machine Learning and uplift models that can help in optimizing marketing costs.

It is widely believed that it is good idea to send marketing offer to all company's customers. In fact it is not always a case – the matter has been described later. While large scale campaigns are costly it is important to consider Return on Investment (ROI) in decision-making.

Is it true that by sending the marketing offer we only extend the chance for the customer to buy our product and therefore extend our profit?. The issue was already investigated [@book_uplift] and it was pointed out that customers of any company can be divided into 4 groups (Figure: \@ref(fig:4groups)). 

```{r 4groups, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Customer types taking into consideration their response to treatment [@4groups_chart]', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_e45e2d97-confmatrix_alt.png")
```

The image matrix was created based on customer decision to buy a product depending on the fact that they were addressed by a marketing campaign or not. The action used for triggering in customers the particular behavior is called treatment. In the 4 groups we distinguish (Figure: \@ref(fig:4groups)):

* <span style="color:darkgreen">***"persuadables"***</span>: the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaign would not buy a product 
* <span style="color:grey">***"sure things"***</span>: the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or not are going to buy a product
* <span style="color:grey">***"lost causes"***</span>: the customers that irrespective of the fact that they experienced treatment or not are **NOT** going to buy a product 
* <span style="color:darkred"> ***"sleeping dogs"***</span>: the customers that without being exposed to marketing campaign would buy a product but in case they receive a marketing offer they resign 

It can be then observed that in case of *"lost causes"* and *"sure things"* sending a marketing offer makes no impact therefore it doesn't make sense to spend money on targeting these customers. As the company we should however pay more attention to the groups *"persuadables"* and *"sleeping dogs"*. In the case of the first group, bearing the costs of the marketing campaign will bring benefits. In the case of the latter, we not only spend money on targeting them but as a result, we will also discourage them from buying the product therefore we as a company lose twice. The case of *"sleeping dogs"* can seem irrealistic, therefore we present an example. 

> *Let's imagine there is a customer that subscribed to our paid newsletter. He forgot that he pays each month fixed fee. He would continue paying unless a company sends him a discount offer. At this moment the customer realizes that he doesn't need the product and unsubscribes.*

By understanding the structure of the company's customers, it can target its offer more effectively.



### Approaches towards uplift modeling

In [@uplift_stanford] it was pointed out that the problem of deciding whether it is profitable to send an offer to a particular customer can be tackled from two different perspectives:  

* predictive response modeling (it is common classification task where model assigns a probability to each of the classes)  
* uplift modeling (where the "incremental" probability of purchase is modeled)  

The latter is tailored to this particular task and is more challenging.
**Uplift modeling is a technique that helps to determine probability gain that the customer by getting the marketing materials will buy a product.**
The field is relatively new. The two most common approaches are [@uplift_approaches]:  

* **Two Model**  
In this method two classifiers are build. The one is trained on observations that received treatment (called *model_T1*) and the second is trained on observations that didn't receive treatment (called *model_T0*). Later the uplift for particular observations is calculated. If the observation experienced treatment then it is an input to the *model_T1* and the probability that the customer will buy a product is calculated. Next it is investigated what would happen if the customer didn't receive treatment. In that case the treatment indicator in observation's feature is changed to "zero". Such a modified record is an input to *model_T0* that predicts the probability that such a customer will buy a product. The uplift is calculated as the difference between the output of the *model_T1* and *model_T0*. The higher the difference, the more profitable is addressing marketing campaign to a particular customer. Analogically, uplift is computed for the people that didn't experienced treatment. 

* **One Model**  
This approach is similar conceptually to the *Two Model* approach with such a difference that instead of building two classifiers only one is used. Therefore every observation is an input to the model that generates prediction. Later the indicator in the treatment column is changed into the negation and such a vector is used as input to the model that once again output probability that the customer buys a product. The uplift is the difference between the two predicted probabilities. 

```{r approches, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Two Model vs One Model approach (own elaboration), where `P1=P(purchase|T=1)` and `P0=P(purchase|T=0)`', out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_one_two_model.png")
```

As uplift modeling is an emerging field there isn't a clear evidence what method is better to use. 


## Dataset

There is a scarcity of well-documented datasets dedicated to uplift modeling. Therefore the authors of [@uplift_dataset_modification] proposed to artificially modify available datasets to extract information about treatment. As the purpose of this story is to investigate XAI techniques in the domain of uplift modeling we decided to use real-life dataset. 
We chose Kevin Hillstrom's dataset from E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge [@uplift_dataset_marketing]. The dataset consists of 64000 records reflecting customers that last purchased within 12 months. As a treatment an e-mail campaign was addressed:

* 1/3 of customers were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Men's merchandise
* 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Women's merchandise
* 1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign *("control group")*  

As an expected behavior the following actions were determined: 

* visit the company's website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign 
* purchase a product from the website within 2 weeks after sending to the customers a marketing campaign 

In the challenge the task was to determine whether the men's or women's e-mail campaign was successful. In order to simplify the problem we reformulated the task - we have focused on ??????????

The features about customers in the dataset are specified in Figure \@ref(fig:dataset):

```{r dataset, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Customer features in the dataset (own elaboration)', out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_xai_customer.jpg")
```

There is also information about customer activity in the two weeks following delivery of the e-mail campaign (these can be interpreted as labels):

* Visit: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer visited website in the following two weeks.
* Conversion: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer purchased merchandise in the following two weeks.
* Spent: Actual dollars spent in the following two weeks.

[wstawić histogram recency i history!!!]

### Feature engineering

The dataset is largely imbalanced - there are only about 15% of positive cases in column *Visit* and 9% in column *Conversion*.
In such a situation we decided to use column *Visit* as a target for the classifier.
As the number of columns is small we decided to use one-hot encoding for transforming categorical variables instead of target encoding. 

## Model exploration and metrics
There are not many packages dedicated to uplift modeling in python. We investigated the two: pylift [@pylift] and pyuplift [@pyuplift]. The latter enables usage of 4 types of models - one of those is the Two Model approach. In the pylift package there is the TransformedOutcome class that generates predictions. However, the model itself is not well described and uses XGBRegressor underneath that is not intuitive. Fortunately the package offer also the class UpliftEval that allows uplift metrics visualization. 
In the scene, we decided to create own classifier (as in the One Model approach) and use UpliftEval class from the pylift model for metric evaluation.
As the classifier we used fine-tuned XGBoost with the score function as the area under the cumulative gain chart (described below). In the figure \@ref(fig:upliftRES) we show the cumulative gain chart for train and test sets. 


```{r upliftRES, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Cumulative gain chart: (left) train set, (right) test set', out.width = '50%', fig.align='default', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_uplift_train.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_uplift_test.png")
```
In order to evaluate performance of uplift models The Qini curve is not suggested as it is vulnerable to overfitting to the treatment label. Therefore the Cumulative gain chart is used. It is the least biased estimate of the uplift. In the package pylift it is implemented based on the formula:
$Cumulative\ gain(\phi) = (\frac {n_{t,1}(\phi)}{n_{t,1}}-\frac {n_{c,1}(\phi)}{n_{c,1}})(\frac{n_t(\phi)+n_c(\phi)}{N_t+N_c})$   
where  
$n_{t,1} (\phi)$ is the number of observations in the treatment group at cutoff level $\phi$ with label 1  
$n_{c,1} (\phi)$ is the number of observations in the control group at cutoff level $\phi$ with label 1  
$n_{t,1}$ is the total number of observations in the treatment group with label 1 (analogically $n_{c,1}$)  
$N_t$ is the total number of observations in treatment group (analogically $N_c$)  

The theoretical plot can be made as follows:  
First the customers are sorted in descending order based on predicted uplift. Later some fraction of data is taken for the analysis (e.g. 10% of the people with the highest score). This cutoff is represented as $\phi$ in the formula. Next the uplift gain is verified for the subset. At the beginning of the curve the gain is the biggest as it refers to the *"persuadables"* group. Later the curve stabilizes as it depicts the groups: *"lost causes"* and *"sure things"*. At the end the curve decreases as there are *"sleeping dogs"* with negative uplift.

### Model

It can be seen that our model is better than random choice but much worse than the practical/theoretical maximum possible. It is also worse than the case without *"sleeping dogs"*. 
However we have to remember what this uplift score indicates. Maximum uplift would mean, that we can always persuade anyone to buy, which is obviously an unrealistic scenario, since our *treatment* is only a single advertisement. Comparing to uplift modelling in different domains, i. e. medical usages, our treatment has generally smaller impact on case, therefore dataset itself is more noisy and cumulative gains are smaller. Worth noting also is, that due to small number of features, there are multiple cases in the dataset where two observations with same features have different answears. Also, since informational entropy is quite small i.e. for any *newbie* there are only 3 (*zip code*) posibilities for observation to have, and we have much more *newbie* observations in the dataset. For non-newbie, we have `2*2=4`(*womens*, *mens*) more possibilities, and two unconstrained dimensions (*recency* and *history*), which is not much more. This kind of noise in data also tremendously impacts the score and requires caution when training models. Also, since uplift itself is an interaction, our model do have to take them into consideration.

Taking previous observations into consideration, model was found using so called local search procedure, what means that we choose some meta-parameters of the model and iteratively, for every meta-parameter approximate derivative (of function from set of metaparemeters to score of trained model) by sampling the local neighbourhood of current value and follow the ascending gradient. Local search stops naturally, when in previus iteration, we did not change any parameter, hence we hit one of the local minima. To be clear, if meta-paremeter is discrete, by approximating local neighborhood we mean just checking close values. For our score function, we've chosen cross validation on cumulative gains. This kind of procedure should seek for highly robust models.  Therefore, it is worth noticing that our model didn't experience any overfitting as its quality on the train and test sets is similar. The resulting major parameters were: maximum depth of 5, high learning rate of 0.7 and only 12 estimators.

### Comparing metrics

Same local search procedure using accuracy as score function failed to converge with any decent quality, because this metric is much less informative in our case, considering especially bias of the dataset. Since only a small number of clients actually purchased, it's really hard to correctly predict a positive case and it's hard to create a (not overtiffed) model that anytime outputs a probability of purchase bigger then 50%. Therefore within the local search with accuracy function, starting local neighborhood was always flat. This might be because in the dataset there is more noise, then positive cases. But fortunately, only important factor, from our prespective is *probability* of the purchase, since uplift is increase of purchase probability after treatment, and it directly transfers into money gain.
To visualize it in a straightforward manner, we present a table comparing our current robust XGBoost model with overfitted one (deep trees, 100 estimators).
```{r overfitTable, echo=FALSE} 
table <- data.frame(
  "Model" = c("Overfitted XGBoost","Robust XGBoost"),
  "Train accuracy" = c(0.87554, 0.85322),
  "Valid accuracy" = c(0.84734, 0.85320),
  "Train cummulative gain" = c(0.71904, 0.0398),
  "Valid cummulative gain" = c(0.02037, 0.0425),
  check.names = FALSE)
knitr::kable(table, caption='Comparing metrics' )
```


As we can see (Table \@ref(tab:overfitTable)) for the overfitted model, while the overfit gap in accuracy scores is only around 2%, cummulative gain drop by 97%. 

## Explanations
The Cumulative gain chart shows that the proposed model brings additional value. Here comes the question of whether the model is reliable? Does it make the decision based on the features that are important from an expert knowledge perspective? Such judgment can be done based on the results of XAI tools.
We decided to investigate model interpretability from instance-level and dataset-level perspective.

### Instance-level

In order to explain model output for particular customer we employed SHAP values [@feature_importance_shap]. 

Before we move to the investigation of SHAP values let's get to know customers that got the highest and the lowest uplift. In this section we will analyze the reliability of predictions for these particular instances. In the table \@ref(tab:personalTABLE) there is all the information provided to the system about the customers.

```{r personalTABLE, echo=FALSE}
tab=read.csv2("images/09_personal.info.csv", sep=',')
knitr::kable(tab, caption='Customer with the highest and the lowest uplift - features' )
```

As can be seen (Table \@ref(tab:personalTABLE)) the customers spend almost the same amount of money during the last 12 months on our company's products.
The person with the highest uplift did last shopping 2 months ago whereas the person with the lowest uplift did it 5 months ago. In the dataset some people purchased the product for the last time even 12 months ago so the person is not the most severe case in that sense. Apart from many other differences among the two customers the key is that the person with the highest uplift received treatment whereas the second customer didn't.


Below we present SHAP values for the customer desribed in \@ref(tab:personalTABLE). The values were computed directly on uplift model \@ref(fig:upliftSHAP).
```{r upliftSHAP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='SHAP values: (left) customer with the lowest uplift, (right) customer with the highest uplift', out.width = '50%', fig.align='default', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_shap_min_uplift.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_shap_max_uplift.png")
```

Conclusions:   
In can be seen that in both cases big contribution to the final result has information about customer history (about 230 USD) and the fact that the customer bought products from Womens collection. What is interesting is the fact that the customers have almost the same values of these two attribute but opposite sign of its contribution. 

We can benefit from additive feature attribution property of SHAP values to model the uplift:

$uplift=P(purchase|\ treatment=1) - P(purchase|\ treatment=0))$ 
$SHAP(uplift)= SHAP(P(purchase|\ treatment=1)) - SHAP(P(purchase|\ treatment=0))$ 

This property gives us a great opportunity to evaluate these two vectors of SHAP values independently. For example if we use any tree-based model, we can make use of tree-based kernel for SHAP value estimation (faster and better convergent) instead of modeling it directly as a black-box (uplift) model.

In a table \@ref(tab:upliftTABLE) there is a comparison of SHAP values obtained using two methods for the customer with the lowest uplift.

```{r upliftTABLE, echo=FALSE}
tab=read.csv2("images/09_shap_diff.csv", sep=',')
options(digits=4)
knitr::kable(tab, caption = 'SHAP values obtained using two methods')
```

Experimental results proved, that these two ways of calculation are providing close estimations, with precision to numerical errors. There are few features that depending on method have small positive or negative SHAP value. This is caused by the fact that for the estimation of SHAP values directly using uplift model the KernelExplainer was used. It has data parameter however in case of big dataset it is recommended in the documentation to take subset of records. In our case we took random subset therefore this could impact the results. Nevertheless, we proved that in case of our example the two methods lead to similar values.


The specificity of uplift models in terms of the possibility to analyse them through additivity of SHAP values gives room for another valuable inspection. 
Below we present how SHAP values differ depending on the fact that the customer was or wasn't addressed by treatment. On *x* axis there are SHAP values in case T=0 and on y axis in case T=1. In each chart there is SHAP value referring to one variable. In situation when the SHAP values are the same irrespective of the presence or absence of treatment they would lie on identity line. Moreover, there is color used as third dimension indicating the group that the particular customer belongs to. We decided to merge two groups (*"sure things"* and *"lost causes"*) as they have uplift almost equall to zero, therefor now we can distinguish 3 groups: *"sleeping dogs"*, *"persuadables"* and *"sure things and lost causes"*. The division was based on the predicted uplift. *"Sleeping dogs"* have considerable negative uplift, *"sure things and lost causes"* have uplift in $[-0.01,0.01]$ and *"persuadables"* have uplift greater than 0.01. The group *"sure things and lost causes"* should has zero uplift, but due to numerical issues we decided to set $\epsilon$ equal to 0.01. As almost all customers were categorized to *"persuadables"*, we decided to show on the plot only 1000 records from this group to maintain chart readability.

```{r recencySHAP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='SHAP values on variable recency in case T=0 and T=1', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_shap_recency.png")
```

It can be seen that *"persuadables"* are slightly above and below identity. 
```{r historySHAP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='SHAP values on variable history in case T=0 and T=1', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_shap_history.png")
```
In Figure \@ref(fig:historySHAP) it can be seen that three customer groups are distinctive groups that could have been obtained through clustering methods.

Apart from continuous variable we also investigated binary variable. Most of them looked similar as Figure \@ref(fig:historySHAP) but there was one exception - variable *womens*. 
```{r womensSHAP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='SHAP values on variable womens in case T=0 and T=1', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_shap_womens.png")
```
It can be seen that the customer groups are overlapping. They constitue very homogeneous groups.


Conclusions:  
In the case of our model there is no need to apply LIME as its main advantages - sparsity - is not important when we have few columns.


### Dataset- (subset-) level
Unfortunately, it's impossible to calculate directly Permutation Feature Importance, because of the previously mentioned problem with lack of full information. We don't know if the client purchase product after treatment or will he buy without treatment as well. Because of having in disposal only historical data (not an oracle), we have only one of these two pieces of information. However, we can make use of the previously computed SHAP values of uplift to calculate the same value of permutational feature importance as an average of local SHAP importance (defined in a permutational way itself, however, calculated more smartly, more in [@feature_importance_shap].

We decided to evaluate feature importance not from the well-known dataset-level but subset-level. 

Below we present the Variable importance plots. The correlations were highlighted in colors. The red color means a feature is positively correlated with the target variable. Analogically the blue color means negative correlation.


```{r sleepingDOGS, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Variable importance - *"sleeping dogs"*', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_sleeping_dogs_feature_importance_correlations.png")
```


```{r noIMPACT, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Variable importance - *"sure things and lost causes"*', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_no_impact_feature_importance_correlations.png")
```


```{r persuadables, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Variable importance - *"persuadables"*', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_persuadables_feature_importance_correlations.png")
```

Conclusions: 
Regardless of the customer groups always *history* and *womens* are among three most important features. This variables in the case of *"sleeping dogs"* and *"sure things and lost causes"* have negative correlation with target variable, whereas in the case of *"persuadables"* they have positive impact. It is wort noticing that regardless of the customer group importance of *segment* variable is low. This is suprising because the presence of *treatment* is substantial element of uplift modeling.

#### Dependence profiles
 
Another tool to investigate model are the dependence plots. There are two options. The most common method is the Partial Dependence Plot and the another one is the SHAP dependence plot. The Partial Dependence Plot shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model [@pdp]. It tells whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. In the SHAP dependence plot we can show how a feature’s value (x-axis) impacted the prediction (y-axis) of every sample (each dot) in a dataset [@shap_dependence_plot]. This provides richer information than the traditional Partial Dependence Plot, because we have at least two additional information: density, variety of observations.???????

We generated the Partial Dependence Plot for all features and the SHAP dependence plot based on 1k observations only for *history* and *recency* features. 

```{r pdp_history, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='History (left) Partial Dependence Plot / Accumulated Local Effects plot, (right) The SHAP Dependence Plot based on 1k observations', out.width = '50%', fig.align='default',fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_history_PDP_ALE.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_history_shap_dependence_plot.png")
```

For our model The SHAP Dependence Plot reflects the shape of the Partial Dependence Plot, while also highlighting the impact of *history* on uplift prediction is extremely different for people with the same value of *history*. Many individuals have a recorded *history* of 250 dollars in our dataset, but the impact of that measurement on their uplift varies.

```{r pdp_recency, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Recency (left) Partial Dependence Plot / Accumulated Local Effects plot, (right) The SHAP Dependence Plot based on 1k observations', out.width = '50%', fig.align='default',fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_recency_PDP_ALE.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_recency_shap_dependence_plot.png")
```

```{r pdp_mens_womens, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Gender', out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_mens_womens_PDP_ALE.png")
```

```{r pdp_newbie, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Newbie', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_newbie_PDP_ALE.png")
```

```{r pdp_zip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Dwelling place', out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_zip_PDP_ALE.png")
```

```{r pdp_channel, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Channel', out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/09_channel_PDP_ALE.png")
```
Since Partial Dependence Profiles are generally parallel to Accumulated Local Effects, we can safely assume that our model does not have (major) interactions. However this does not mean, that we can use some classifier without interactions, because here we model directly the uplift, which is difference between preditions and is itself an interaction.


#### Sweet-spot
However, the most important observation here, should be that while at first glance we can only manipulate the Treatment variable, these tools also give us opportunity to *choose also best time to contact the customer*.  Intuitively, recency function should be concave, aiming to find some "sweet-spot" between time when customer "just went out from the shop" and "forgot about this". This plot can be interpretted in this manner, but also with some sinusoidal noise at bigger values, where classifier is littlebit overfitted to remember distinctive cases. Here visibly, this sweet-spot appears to be two months after last purchase.


#### Biggest influence
Biggest influence can be achieved on customers who bought 'womens' products.  Also customers who we know that bought 'mens' products can be easier to convince (especially since this dataset is focused on campaign directed to specific gender). This does not stand in conflict with previos statement due to two reasons: any bought products mean that this person is not a "newbie" (7), and this means we still have more information about this customer to approach him in personalized manner (some products do not have any "gender" specified).

##### Choosing communication type
Continueing previous reasoning, another thing we can affect is initially removed from the dataset *segment type*, which means if we send an advertisement mail targetted on women or men. Considering how important is *womans* variable, we propose a following policy:
1. Womens channel alone implies womans segment
2. Mens channel alone implies mens segment
3. Both or lack of this information, due to higher impact of *womans* channel, should be treated like *womans segment*.

#### Influence from other factors
Other plots can be used for better understanding of the customer persuadability. Since only variable considerably reducing estimated uplift is *newbie* we can safely conclude, that marketing campaigns have better impact on your previous customers, which is quite an intuitive conclusion. Analyzing other factors, encoded area of living (*rural*, *suburban*, *urban*) do not have any major influences bigger then statistical error maybe except *rural*, which characterises with slightly better persuadability and suprisingly is only factor that may have some interactions. Reffering to channel, it is best to target customers who bought only by web in past months. It may be connected to the fact that our treatment is concucted via email, however the differences are minor.



## Summary and conclusions 
Using XAI for uplift modeling helps to understand its complex models better. The analysis goes beyond just assessing whether the model is reliable... it can help the executive to understand better the company customers - their behavior without paying for some extra surveys to investigate their attitude towards the company.

A vital part of our work was adjusting XAI techniques for the particularities of uplift modeling. We found out that thanks to its additivity SHAP values are well suited for uplift modeling - we showed two methods of using it. We identified limitations of well-known Permutation Feature Importance in terms of explaining uplift modeling. It is caused by the fact that unlike in other supervised models here we do not have exactly labels. Therefore we used the generalization of SHAP values that converge to Permutation Feature Importance. We employed the analysis for the three groups of customers based on the corresponding uplift.

.........................................

Here add the most important conclusions related to the XAI analysis.
What did you learn? 
Where were the biggest difficulties?
What else did you recommend?

## Future works
As a initial feature engineering, we simplified our problem merging *womans segment* and *mens segment* into one, and then after PDP plots proposed a policy for choosing them. However, it is not an only possible apporach. We can try going beyond standard uplift modelling and try to model directly uplift with 2 possible outcomes i.e. create for model *purchase* prediction, and then check if sending *womans* or *mens* email is more profitable, resulting in following equation:

$uplift=max(P(purchase\ |\ womans\_treatment=1) - P(purchase\ |\ womans\_treatment=0), P(purchase\ |\ mens\_treatment=1) - P(purchase\ |\ mens\_treatment=0))$ 


However, this leaves us with several open-ended questions i.e.: can we now calcualte SHAP values indirectly, using previously presented effecient technique? Surely the max function breaks the addivity of uplift function, but maybe it is possible using some other method?
